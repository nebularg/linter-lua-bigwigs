# linter-lua-bigwigs

Lint BigWigs modules.

## Installation

I'm probably not going to publish this, so to install you need clone the repo
or download it somewhere, open a command prompt there, then run:

> apm link

to make a symlink in .atom/packages that points to your directory.

And

> apm install

to install the dependencies.

Before using this package, you must ensure that you have a `lua` installed on
your system. If the program is not available on your system path, you will need
to set the path in settings:

File -> Settings -> Packages -> Linter Lua BigWigs -> **Executable Path**
