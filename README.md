# linter-lua-bigwigs

Lint BigWigs modules.

## Installation

I'm probably not going to publish this, so you'll need to install it manually:

```
apm install nebularg/linter-lua-bigwigs
```

Before using this package, make sure that you have Lua installed on your
system, any version should work. If `lua` is not available on your system path,
you will need to set the path in the package settings.
